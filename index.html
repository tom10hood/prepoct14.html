The hardest thing I have learned in class I have learned is the ability to move boxes with css. To move boxes you use css to manipulate existing data in HTML. First you identify the name of the box. Then you use a curly bracket. Then you float the box to where you want ex. (float: right;) and then skip a line. Then identify the height of the box ex. (height: 120 px;). Finally you identify the width ex. (width; 300 px;). I hope this helps! 
The hardest thing I have not yet understood in this class is the d3. Algorithm. I understand how to do it, the basic structure and it’s function, but I do not yet understand WHY it works. The d3. Algorithm is used to make elements inside of html using JavaScript and to then insert viewable data in an html document. I do not understand why the lines of code work in the specific order they are lined up in. I try to understand computer science like a story but it doesn’t make sense to me why the lines of code are ordered in the way they are.
